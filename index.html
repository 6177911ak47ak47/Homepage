I am now a forth year undergraduate student at <a href = "https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/"> School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University</a>.  
Here is my CV.
 <br>
I am interested in probability theory, especially in random geometry and probabilistic conbinations.
My email address is: duhang at pku dot edu dot cn<br>.
