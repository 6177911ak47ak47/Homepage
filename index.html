Welcome to my homepage! My name is Hang Du and I am now a forth year undergraduate student at <a href = "https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/"> School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University</a>.  
I am interested in probability theory, especially in random geometry and probabilistic conbinations.
My email address is: duhang-at-pku-dot-edu-dot-cn<br>.
